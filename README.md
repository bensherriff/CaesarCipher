# CaesarCipher
A simple Caesar Cipher. Use cases include encryption, decryption, and cracking encrypted messages. The reason for
creating this project was to try basic encryption and decoding using one of the oldest encryption methods.

## Introduction

### Encryption
Encrypt a string consisting of letters and whitespace using a key. Valid keys are integers between 0 and 26.

### Decryption
Decrypt a string consisting of letters and whitespace using a key. Valid keys are integers between 0 and 26.

### Cracking
Crack the encrypted string using multiple methods and compare results.
* Brute Force
* Character Frequency

## How to use
